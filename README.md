The desktop application is supposed to be a drawing tool for digital artists. They can also edit their previous drawings or upload their drawings to the website, to be "sold".
The reason why we created our own basic drawing tool instead of using a third party library was to fulfill the requirements from UCN.

The website acts as a "digital art gallery", where customers can browse the market and add items to their shopping cart. They can also view their profile and previous orders.
There is also the option to create a new account on the website.
